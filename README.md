This example demonstrates a common but subtle error in C#: directly accessing a backing field of a property instead of using the property itself.  While it may seem innocuous in simple cases, this practice can have far-reaching consequences if the property encapsulates additional logic like validation, logging, or other side effects.

The bug.cs file contains code with this error. The bugSolution.cs file shows the corrected version, emphasizing the use of the property for consistency and maintainability.
